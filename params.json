If publication is required from multiple threads, each required to create its own publisher instance.\r\nAll messages are sent by default to amq.headers exchange with two headers: Name and Namespace. By default it is type name and name space, however id class is decorated with DataContractAttribute Name and Namespace will be taken from it (if specified). \r\n\r\n##### Subscribe for messages\r\n\r\n```c#\r\nusing (IBus bus = new RabbitMQBus(busId))\r\n{\r\n\tusing (ISubscriber subscriber = bus.CreateSubscriber())\r\n    {\r\n\t\tsubscriber.Subscribe((Action<Person>) (p =>\r\n        {\r\n            // Do your work here\r\n        }));\r\n\r\n\t\t// Start consuming messages\r\n        subscriber.Open();\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSubscriber creates by default temporary queue, and each subscription binds this queue to amq.headers exchange with Name and Namespace headers. \r\nThus only this particular message type will arrive to the subscriber.\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of features inside, most covered by tests and you are welcome to take a look.\r\n\r\nI am working on documentation, so stay tuned.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n","google":"UA-63064967-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
